Summary: Introductory post

Hey there!

I'm Navin, and this is where I will be posting updates about the stuff I learn/explore as part of GSoC 2015. 


I'm going to be working with the fine people at the DBpedia project *(to be more specific, the JSONpedia project)* and will be working on enhancing the extractors used for extracting information from Wikipedia.

 
For a quick overview of my project, visit [my project proposal page][1].


Other quick links are in the left menu.
